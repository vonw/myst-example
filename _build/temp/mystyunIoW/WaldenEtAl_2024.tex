%  ABSTRACT and PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY
%
% A good Abstract will begin with a short description of the problem
% being addressed, briefly describe the new data or analyses, then
% briefly states the main conclusion(s) and how they are supported and
% uncertainties.

% The Plain Language Summary should be written for a broad audience,
% including journalists and the science-interested public, that will not have
% a background in your field.
%
% A Plain Language Summary is required in GRL, JGR: Planets, JGR: Biogeosciences,
% JGR: Oceans, G-Cubed, Reviews of Geophysics, and JAMES.
